# Predictive Ship Maintenance system

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI-powered system designed to assist ships crew to enhance vessel maintenance efficiency predicting mechanical failures. Vessel downtime due to mechanical failures disrupts operations and incurs significant costs. Maintenance often relies on fixed schedules or reactive repairs, which can be inefficient. Seagoing vessels commonly use planned maintenance programs with hour and day counter setups. These are set to match maintenance manuals for each machinery equipment to comply with the recommended maintenance. Due to external factors such as heat, humidity, corrosion etc. can cause unplanned maintenance. An AI-powered system to predict utilizing sensored data from external factors could change the maintenance procedures onboard, improving downtime periods, sudden mechanical failures and savings in costs.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

It will not solve how to carry out the maintenance, only predicts and functions as an overseeing system to support the planned maintenance plan onboard.

## What next?

Seafaring is heavily regulated industry.
